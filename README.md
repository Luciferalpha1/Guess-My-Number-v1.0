# Guess My Number â€“ JavaScript Mini Project
A fun and interactive number guessing game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
---
## About the Game

"Guess My Number" is a browser-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated secret number within a certain range. The game gives feedback after each guess â€” too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible to maximize your score.

---
##  How It Works 

- A random number is generated between 1 and a maximum limit (default is 20).
- Player inputs a number and clicks **Check!**.
- Feedback is shown: `Too high`, `Too low`, or `Perfect Guess!`.
- The score starts at the maximum and decreases with each wrong guess.
- The best score is saved as a **high score**.
- 
## âœ¨ Features

- Score and high score tracking
- Responsive feedback for guesses
- Reset button to start a new game
- Simple and nostalgic UI with pixel-style fonts

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Goals (Coming Soon)

These are ideas planned for future versions to improve gameplay and learning:

- [ ]  **Difficulty Levels** â€“ Easy (1â€“20), Medium (1â€“50), Hard (1â€“100)
- [ ]  **Timer Mode** â€“ Guess the number within a time limit
- [ ]  **Limited Attempts** â€“ Especially in Hard mode (e.g., only 15 guesses)
- [ ]  **Hints System** â€“ Provide hints like "It's a prime number", "Divisible by 5", etc.
- [ ]  **Hot/Cold Feedback** â€“ Indicate how close the guess is (e.g., "Super close!")
- [ ]  **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**
- [ ]  **Mobile Responsiveness**
- [ ]  **Sound Effects** on correct/wrong guess
